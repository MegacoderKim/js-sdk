    </h2>
    <p>Action is the unit of tracking with HyperTrack. It is the starting point for building your use case.</p>
    <p>This guide covers all that you need to know about actions in order to use them effectively. We will also cover
      common <a href="https://www.hypertrack.com/usecases">use cases</a> that developers have built with HyperTrack and
      point you to quick APIs and tutorials to build them with actions.</p>
    <p>Feel free to build anything that you can imagine with actions that we might not have imagined yet. We would love
      to hear from you when you do.</p>

      1. Use model
    </h2>
    <p>As a first step, you need to decide when to create and complete an action.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>This is an important decision and we would encourage you to be thoughtful about it. We would be happy to chat
        with you about this to help.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Creating actions will start tracking the movement of the user and completing the action will end it. </p>
        <img src="https://docs.hypertrack.com/assets/single_action.png" alt="Tracking one action">
    <p>When multiple actions are created for a user, tracking starts with the first action created and ends with the
      last action completed. You may create as many actions as you want for a user at any point in time.</p>

      1.3. Action types

    <p>Each action may be created with an action type picked from our list or a custom type as defined by you. Actions
      for multiple types may be created for a user.</p>

      <i class="fa fa-anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></a>1.4. Defining your own actions</h3>
    <p>
      Most developers <em>create</em> actions from the back-end or app when the respective action is created or
      assigned to a user in their own system. They <em>complete</em> actions from the app or back-end when the
      equivalent action is completed by the user in their own system.
     Developers specify an <a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="expected-place-and-time">expected place</a>
      where the action is expected to complete in order to unlock
      <a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="additional-features">additional features</a>.
       </p>

    <p>Here are a few common use cases and how you can program them using actions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Track via a web URL using the the unique trck.at tracking URL that is returned in the response object of the
          Action. This is a public URL that may be shared with customers or anyone you want.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Track via your HyperTrack <a href="https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/actions">dashboard</a> or <a
          href="https://docs.hypertrack.com/dashboard/widgets.html">embed these views</a>
          into your own dashboard.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Track via your native <a href="https://docs.hypertrack.com/usecases/livetracking/android/installing.html">Android</a>,
          <a href="https://docs.hypertrack.com/usecases/livetracking/ios/installing.html">iOS</a> or <a

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Follow the tutorial <a appScrollTo="" class="hidden-links">here</a> to build live tracking experience.</p>
