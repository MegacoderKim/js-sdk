<p> <strong> Enable server<>SDK communication!</strong> <br /> The SDK has a bi-directional communication model with the server. This enables the SDK to run on a variable frequency model, which balances the fine trade-off between low latency tracking and battery efficiency. It also enables us to get location, activity and health data from SDK on-demand. Finally, it adds robustness to the SDK. <br />
For this purpose, the Android SDK uses FCM or GCM silent notifications. This guide will take you through the setup. <br /><br /><a href="https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/onboarding/fcm-android" style="display: flex;justify-content: center;"><button class="btn btn-primary"> Setup FCM</button></a></p>
